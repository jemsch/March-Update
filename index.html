                <h3>C420 Midwinters</h3>
                <p>My crew and I traveled to Florida for four days to compete in the national Midwinter Sailing
                    Championship in the Club 420 boat.
                    We had both good races (we placed sixth in one) and bad races, and overall we placed mid-fleet.

                <h3>BMUN</h3>
                <p>The Design Tech Model United Nations team spent three days in Berkeley at the 2019 Berkeley Model
                    United Nations Conference.
                    This conference was my third ever and I received a Research Award for my five page paper I wrote in
                    the months preceding the conference.
                    My committee was a specialized Historical Crisis committee beginning on October 31st 1918 in order
                    to discuss the Middle East after the end of WWI.
                    I represented Chaim Weizmann, the President of the British Zionist Organization, and my main policy
                    point was the creation of an independent Israeli state.
                    Overall, I learned a <strong>ton</strong>, and I look forward to competing next year!

                <h3>"The Test of Doom"</h3>
                <p>Yes, I took the March SAT. And yes, it was extremely... wack?
                    There was a fifth section of the multiple choice aspect of the test that had everyone in my room
                    reeling from surprise
                    (because none of the CollegeBoard practice tests included a fifth section... how rude).
                    Regardless, I think I did well and am dying in anticipation for the score release this friday.

                <p>For the morning d.lab class of Intersession, I am an Oracle intern with my friend Jeremy. We are
                    working on creating an informational film explaining an Oracle Help Center.

                <h3>Book Update</h3>
                <p>I've recently started reading The Origin of Language by Eric Gans. He released a second edition which
                    is very helpful because I wasn't planning on spending $300 on a used copy from Ebay.

                <p>Yes, you read that right. Here are a few of my favorite memes of this winter/spring season! To my
                    amazement, there has been a resurgence of Minecraft themed memes, so buckle your seat belts, folks.
